# My dotfiles

Dotfiles are organized using GNU Stow. Check [Using GNU Stow to manage your dotfiles](https://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html) for reference. To enable these on your system do:

```bash
cd dotfiles
stow vim
stow tmux
stow karabiner
... # repeat for all programs you need configuration for
```
